# SNN

Woke up Thanksgiving morning 2024 and thought this was a good idea...

The website is pretty intuitive. For the main functionality, just upload an image, and the backend neural network will try to guess what anime show it is from. There are a few games on the right that the user can play. In some of them, they can compete against the neural network.

Network architecture/training details are left out of this repository for confidentiality purposes.
